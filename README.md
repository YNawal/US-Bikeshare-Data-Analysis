# US-Bikeshare-Data-Analysis


# Description

In this work, I used Python to explore data related to bikeshare systems for three major bikeshare systems in the United States. The task of this work is twofold: first, to become famliar with Pyhton and secondly, to discover data analysis process.

Through this process, I performed 

* data wrangling to unify the format of data from the three systems and;
* write code to compute descriptive statistics.
* You will also make use of a package that is not part of the standard Python library to help you visualize the data.

By the end of this work I was able to:

* Coose the appropriate data types (e.g. strings, floats) and data structures (e.g. lists, dictionaries) to carry out the required analysis tasks.
* Use correctly loops and conditional statements to process the data.
* Use Functions to reduce repetitive code.
* Use packages to carry out advanced tasks such as reading and writing files and creating visualizations.
* Organize my code and improve its readability by integrating docstrings, comments.
* Ask questions and answer them using data statistics and visulization.
