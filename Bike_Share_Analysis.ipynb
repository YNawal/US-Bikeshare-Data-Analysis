    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles for short trips, typically 30 minutes or less. Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will perform an exploratory analysis on data provided by [Motivate](https://www.motivateco.com/), a bike-share system provider for many major cities in the United States. You will compare the system usage between three large cities: New York City, Chicago, and Washington, DC. You will also see if there are any differences within each system for those users that are registered, regular users and those users that are short-term, casual users."

    "## Posing Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Before looking at the bike sharing data, you should start by asking questions you might want to understand about the bike share data. Consider, for example, if you were working for Motivate. What kinds of information would you want to know about in order to make smarter business decisions? If you were a user of the bike-share service, what factors might influence how you would want to use the service?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 1**: Write at least two questions related to bike sharing that you think could be answered by data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answers**: \n",
    "\n",
    "**If I was working for Motivate, I would ask:**\n",
    "1. What are the cities where we expect the bike-sharing system to work? I take into consideration the population number, the means of transport existed and distance between important service locations in the given city.\n",
    "2. How many bikes must be available at the docks for each city, to ensure continuous service and to not make more bikes available than necessary? \n",
    "3. Would it be profitable to offer a lower trip price to the registered users in a given city?\n",
    "4. What is the appropriate time to offer promotions?\n",
    "\n",
    "**If I was a user of the bike-share service, I would ask:**\n",
    "5. Do the docks well cover the city, where the use of the bike becomes more comfortable than the use of competitive means of transport.\n",
    "6. Can I return the bike to any dock? "

    "## Data Collection and Wrangling\n",
    "\n",
    "Now it's time to collect and explore our data. In this project, we will focus on the record of individual trips taken in 2016 from our selected cities: New York City, Chicago, and Washington, DC. Each of these cities has a page where we can freely download the trip data.:\n",
    "\n",
    "- New York City (Citi Bike): [Link](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data)\n",
    "- Chicago (Divvy): [Link](https://www.divvybikes.com/system-data)\n",
    "- Washington, DC (Capital Bikeshare): [Link](https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/system-data)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you visit these pages, you will notice that each city has a different way of delivering its data. Chicago updates with new data twice a year, Washington DC is quarterly, and New York City is monthly. **However, you do not need to download the data yourself.** The data has already been collected for you in the `/data/` folder of the project files. While the original data for 2016 is spread among multiple files for each city, the files in the `/data/` folder collect all of the trip data for the year into one file per city. Some data wrangling of inconsistencies in timestamp format within each city has already been performed for you. In addition, a random 2% sample of the original data is taken to make the exploration more manageable. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 2**: However, there is still a lot of data for us to investigate, so it's a good idea to start off by looking at one entry from each of the cities we're going to analyze. Run the first code cell below to load some packages and functions that you'll be using in your analysis. Then, complete the second code cell to print out the first trip recorded from each of the cities (the second line of each data file)."

    "If everything has been filled out correctly, you should see below the printout of each city name (which has been parsed from the data file name) that the first trip has been parsed in the form of a dictionary. When you set up a `DictReader` object, the first row of the data file is normally interpreted as column names. Every other row in the data file will use those column names as keys, as a dictionary is generated for each row.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will be useful since we can refer to quantities by an easily-understandable label instead of just a numeric index. For example, if we have a trip stored in the variable `row`, then we would rather get the trip duration from `row['duration']` instead of `row[0]`.\n",

    "It should also be observable from the above printout that each city provides different information. Even where the information is the same, the column names and formats are sometimes different. To make things as simple as possible when we get to the actual exploration, we should trim and clean the data. Cleaning the data makes sure that the data formats across the cities are consistent, while trimming focuses only on the parts of the data we are most interested in to make the exploration easier to work with.\n",

    "You will generate new data files with five values of interest for each trip: trip duration, starting month, starting hour, day of the week, and user type. Each of these may require additional wrangling depending on the city:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Duration**: This has been given to us in seconds (New York, Chicago) or milliseconds (Washington). A more natural unit of analysis will be if all the trip durations are given in terms of minutes.\n",
    "- **Month**, **Hour**, **Day of Week**: Ridership volume is likely to change based on the season, time of day, and whether it is a weekday or weekend. Use the start time of the trip to obtain these values. The New York City data includes the seconds in their timestamps, while Washington and Chicago do not. The [`datetime`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html) package will be very useful here to make the needed conversions.\n",
    "- **User Type**: It is possible that users who are subscribed to a bike-share system will have different patterns of use compared to users who only have temporary passes. Washington divides its users into two types: 'Registered' for users with annual, monthly, and other longer-term subscriptions, and 'Casual', for users with 24-hour, 3-day, and other short-term passes. The New York and Chicago data uses 'Subscriber' and 'Customer' for these groups, respectively. For consistency, you will convert the Washington labels to match the other two.\n",

    "If you followed the use of the `.hist()` and `.show()` functions exactly like in the example, you're probably looking at a plot that's completely unexpected. The plot consists of one extremely tall bar on the left, maybe a very short second bar, and a whole lot of empty space in the center and right. Take a look at the duration values on the x-axis. This suggests that there are some highly infrequent outliers in the data. Instead of reprocessing the data, you will use additional parameters with the `.hist()` function to limit the range of data that is plotted. Documentation for the function can be found [[here]](https://matplotlib.org/devdocs/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.hist.html#matplotlib.pyplot.hist).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 5**: Use the parameters of the `.hist()` function to plot the distribution of trip times for the Subscribers in your selected city. Do the same thing for only the Customers. Add limits to the plots so that only trips of duration less than 75 minutes are plotted. As a bonus, set the plots up so that bars are in five-minute wide intervals. For each group, where is the peak of each distribution? How would you describe the shape of each distribution?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: \n",
    "\n",
    "For Customers group, the peak of distribution is at 5 minutes and for Subscribers group, it is at 20 minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Distribution of Trip Duration for both types of users is **right skewed**, however, Customers distribution **has a right tail longer** than of the Subscribers distribution, hence it is more skewed to the right.\n"

    "## Performing Your Own Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, you've performed an initial exploration into the data available. You have compared the relative volume of trips made between three U.S. cities and the ratio of trips made by Subscribers and Customers. For one of these cities, you have investigated differences between Subscribers and Customers in terms of how long a typical trip lasts. Now it is your turn to continue the exploration in a direction that you choose. Here are a few suggestions for questions to explore:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How does ridership differ by month or season? Which month / season has the highest ridership? Does the ratio of Subscriber trips to Customer trips change depending on the month or season?\n",
    "- Is the pattern of ridership different on the weekends versus weekdays? On what days are Subscribers most likely to use the system? What about Customers? Does the average duration of rides change depending on the day of the week?\n",
    "- During what time of day is the system used the most? Is there a difference in usage patterns for Subscribers and Customers?\n",
    "\n",
    "If any of the questions you posed in your answer to question 1 align with the bullet points above, this is a good opportunity to investigate one of them. As part of your investigation, you will need to create a visualization. If you want to create something other than a histogram, then you might want to consult the [Pyplot documentation](https://matplotlib.org/devdocs/api/pyplot_summary.html). In particular, if you are plotting values across a categorical variable (e.g. city, user type), a bar chart will be useful. The [documentation page for `.bar()`](https://matplotlib.org/devdocs/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.bar.html#matplotlib.pyplot.bar) includes links at the bottom of the page with examples for you to build off of for your own use.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 6**: Continue the investigation by exploring another question that could be answered by the data available. Document the question you want to explore below. Your investigation should involve at least two variables and should compare at least two groups. You should also use at least one visualization as part of your explorations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: \n",
    "\n",
    "**6.1. How does ridership differ by month or season? Which month / season has the highest ridership? Does the ratio of Subscriber trips to Customer trips change depending on the month or season?**\n",
    "\n",
    "For NYC city:\n",
    "\n",
    "Riderchip differs from one month/season to another, when we observe the highest ridership in summer(1) season, specially in September. The ratio of subscriber trips to customer trips is larger in fall and winter seasons than in summer and spring. This is due to several reasons, including the following:\n",
    "a. Because subscribers are mostly the residents of the city and use bike-sharing system for their different displacements.\n",
    "b. In summer (even in spring) the tourism is active by residents and visitors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**6.2. Is the pattern of ridership different on the weekends versus weekdays? On what days are Subscribers most likely to use the system? What about Customers? Does the average duration of rides change depending on the day of the week?**\n",
    "\n",
    "For NYC city:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the daily visulazations, ridership is higer in the weekends compared to weekdays.\n",
    "Subscribers use bike-sharing system more in the week days than in the weekends, while custumers do the opposite.\n",
    "Yes, the average duration of rides change depending on the day of the week. It is higher on the weekends by 2 to 3.5 minutes compared to the average in the weekdays.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6.3. During what time of day is the system used the most? Is there a difference in usage patterns for Subscribers and Customers?**\n",
    "\n",
    "For NYC city:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the houlerly ridership bar charts, we observe two time areas in which the system is used the most. The first time area involves the hours **7h, 8h and 9h** while the second area involves the hours **16h, 17h, 18h and 19h**. It is clear that these time areas represent the **rush hours**. \n",
    "Yes, there is a difference in system usage for the two user type. From subscribers ridership bar chart, the system usage by subscribers reaches the peak at rush hours. \n",
    "From customers ridership bar chart, we observe a very low ridership in the morning rush hour. Ridership starts rising from the **11h until 15h**, to come back down again. \n",
    "\n",
    "**6.4. how many stations were used in each city:**\n",
    "To answer to this question, I added addtional filesnames (star_id, end_id trip station) to our data file. see **time_of_trip** function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Used stations number in NYC is 647.\n",
    "In NYC, the proportion of trips starting from and ending at the same station is 1.9%.\n",
    "In NYC, the proportion of trips starting from one station and ending at another is 98.1%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Used stations number in Chicago is 559.\n",
    "In Chicago, the proportion of trips starting from and ending at the same station is 3.4%.\n",
    "In Chicago, the proportion of trips starting from one station and ending at another is 96.6%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Used stations number in Washington is 420.\n",
    "In Washington, the proportion of trips starting from and ending at the same station is 3.6%.\n",
    "In Washington, the proportion of trips starting from one station and ending at another is 96.4%.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**6.5. what is the most used station in NYC:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In NYC, the most used station is station_id:519. It is used 5945 times in 2016\n",
    "\n",
    "Refer to **POSING QUESTION** section:\n",
    "\n",
    "I asked about How many bikes must be available at the docks for each city, to ensure continuous service and to not make more bikes available than necessary?\n",
    "Knowing the average trips duration, the number of trips in day/month/season can help here.\n",
    "\n",
    "I asked if it would be profitable to offer a lower trip price to the registered users in a given city?\n",
    "The ratio of subscribers to customers trips can answer this question widely. The sum of subscribers trips duration is bigger than of customers.\n"

    "Congratulations on completing the project! This is only a sampling of the data analysis process: from generating questions, wrangling the data, and to exploring the data. Normally, at this point in the data analysis process, you might want to draw conclusions about the data by performing a statistical test or fitting the data to a model for making predictions. There are also a lot of potential analyses that could be performed on the data which are not possible with only the data provided. For example, detailed location data has not been investigated. Where are the most commonly used docks? What are the most common routes? As another example, weather has potential to have a large impact on daily ridership. How much is ridership impacted when there is rain or snow? Are subscribers or customers affected more by changes in weather?\n",

    "**Answer**: \n",
    "\n",
    "I will be interested to apply the techniques of data science on **hypermarket with branches**. I would like to be able to know about:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The amount of sales made in different time periods; in weekdays, weekends, holidays, promotions days.\n",
    "- The number of visitors and customers. The less/most crowded branch. The most profitable branch. The number of loyal customers in each branch.\n",
    "- Select a group of top selling products (and a group of the least sold products) in a specific period.  \n",
    "- The number of products still available. The products that will be expired in a given time.  Is the right moment to offer promotions? For which products?\n",
    "- How do sales of a new product evolve? How do sales of a product of a new supplier evolve?\n",
    "- How the nature pavilion grows? The number of customers who buy regularly organic products? The most popular organic products?\n",
    "- I would like to make a comparison between sales of food and non-food products (textiles, furniture ..ect).\n",
    "- I would like to visualize the total sales by product.\n",
    "- Compare sales of two products of the same type from different suppliers.\n",

    "> **Tip**: If we want to share the results of our analysis with others, we aren't limited to giving them a copy of the jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) file. We can also export the Notebook output in a form that can be opened even for those without Python installed. From the **File** menu in the upper left, go to the **Download as** submenu. You can then choose a different format that can be viewed more generally, such as HTML (.html) or\n",
    "PDF (.pdf). You may need additional packages or software to perform these exports.\n",

    "> If you are working on this project via the Project Notebook page in the classroom, you can also submit this project directly from the workspace. **Before you do that**, you should save an HTML copy of the completed project to the workspace by running the code cell below. If it worked correctly, the output code should be a 0, and if you click on the jupyter icon in the upper left, you should see your .html document in the workspace directory. Alternatively, you can download the .html copy of your report following the steps in the previous paragraph, then _upload_ the report to the directory (by clicking the jupyter icon).\n",

    "> Either way, once you've gotten the .html report in your workspace, you can complete your submission by clicking on the \"Submit Project\" button to the lower-right hand side of the workspace."
